Calculations Mentioned So Far
From trustee/calculator.html:
Total Savings = Number of Participants * Weekly Contribution * Number of Weeks

Joining Fees = Number of Participants * Joining Fee per Participant

Late Fees = (Number of Participants * 0.10) * Late Fee per Week * Number of Weeks (assuming 10% late)

Trustee Earnings = Total Savings * (Trustee Commission / 100)

Investment Return Earnings = Total Savings * (Investment Return / 100)

Annual Earnings = (Trustee Earnings + Investment Return Earnings + Late Fees) * 3 (3 cycles)

Wholesale Cost per 10Kg Bag = Rice RRP per 10Kg Bag * (1 - Wholesale Discount / 100)

Member Price per 10Kg Bag = Rice RRP per 10Kg Bag * (1 - Member Discount / 100)

Bundles Sold = Floor(Number of Participants * 0.50) (50% choose food)

Food Revenue = Bundles Sold * Member Price per 10Kg Bag

Food Cost = Bundles Sold * Wholesale Cost per 10Kg Bag

Food Profit = Food Revenue - Food Cost

Break-even Participants = Ceiling((Number of Participants * Weekly Contribution * Number of Weeks) / Member Price per 10Kg Bag)

Max Trustee Earnings = Trustee Earnings + Food Profit

Recommended Participants = Min(50, Max(5, Floor(Total Savings / 8000))) (based on 8000 PHP goal)

Payout per Member = Weekly Contribution * Number of Weeks

From trustee/member-data.html:
Total Saved = Weeks Paid So Far * Agreed Weekly Payment

Payout Amount = Agreed Weekly Payment * Total Weeks to Pay

Goods Split = 1 - (Cash Split / 100)

Cash Payout = Payout Amount * (Cash Split / 100)

Goods Payout = Payout Amount * Goods Split

Payout Date = Signup Date + (Total Weeks to Pay * 7 days)

From members/status.html:
Progress = (Total Saved / Payout Amount) * 100

All Possible Calculations Based on the Entire List
Based on Input Fields and Mentioned Calculations:
Total Contributions Collected = Number of Participants * Agreed Weekly Payment * Weeks Paid So Far

Total Potential Earnings = Trustee Earnings + Investment Return Earnings + Food Profit + Late Fees

Average Weekly Earnings = Total Potential Earnings / Number of Weeks

Cost per Participant = (Joining Fee per Participant + Insurance Cost per Participant) + (Weekly Contribution * Number of Weeks * Reserve Fund Contribution / 100)

Net Profit per Cycle = Total Potential Earnings - (Cost per Participant * Number of Participants)

Annual Net Profit = Net Profit per Cycle * 3

Discounted Bundle Value = (Canned Goods RRP per Unit + Holiday Treats RRP per Unit + Rice RRP per 10Kg Bag * Bundle Quantity per Member) * (1 - Member Discount / 100)

Total Bundle Cost = (Wholesale Cost per 10Kg Bag * Bundle Quantity per Member + Canned Goods RRP per Unit * (1 - Wholesale Discount / 100) + Holiday Treats RRP per Unit * (1 - Wholesale Discount / 100) + Packaging Cost per Bundle) * Bundles Sold

Bundle Profit = Discounted Bundle Value * Bundles Sold - Total Bundle Cost

Break-even Contribution = (Total Bundle Cost + Total Savings) / (Number of Participants * Number of Weeks)

Adjusted Payout = Payout per Member * (1 - Inflation Adjustment / 100)

Late Payment Penalty = Late Fee per Week * (Number of Weeks - Weeks Paid So Far) * (Number of Participants - lateParticipants)

Referral Bonus = Referral Count * (Weekly Contribution * Number of Weeks * 0.05) (e.g., 5% of referred memberâ€™s contribution)

Emergency Withdrawal Amount = Total Saved * 0.50 (e.g., 50% limit)

Taxable Income = Total Potential Earnings * (Tax Rate / 100)

Net Trustee Income = Total Potential Earnings - Taxable Income - Administrative Fee per Cycle

Community Savings Pool = Total Savings + (Number of Participants * Joining Fee per Participant) - Trustee Earnings

Payout Delay Days = (Number of Weeks - Weeks Paid So Far) * 7

Average Savings per Member = Total Saved / Number of Participants

Cross-Field Combinations:
Total Administrative Cost = Administrative Fee per Cycle * Ceiling(Number of Weeks / 4) (e.g., quarterly billing)

Insurance Coverage = Number of Participants * Insurance Cost per Participant * Number of Weeks

Adjusted Wholesale Cost = Wholesale Cost per 10Kg Bag * (1 + Inflation Adjustment / 100)

Member Retention Rate = (Weeks Paid So Far / Total Weeks to Pay) * 100

Group Expansion Potential = Maximum Group Size Cap - Number of Participants

Cycle Completion Rate = (Weeks Paid So Far / Number of Weeks) * 100 * Number of Participants

Total Referral Impact = Referral Count * Payout per Member

Net Bundle Profit Margin = (Bundle Profit / Food Revenue) * 100
