### Why This is Good for You as a Trustee

1. **Steady Extra Income**
   - As a trustee, you earn a commission of up to 10% on the weekly contributions of your group. For example, with 10 members contributing 500 PHP each week, that’s 5,000 PHP total, and you could earn up to 500 PHP per week. Over a 16-week cycle, this adds up to 8,000 PHP, with potential for three cycles a year.
   - You also benefit from profits on food bundles (e.g., rice, canned goods) by negotiating wholesale discounts, and you can set an administrative fee per cycle to cover your expenses.

2. **Easy Management with Online Tools**
   - The Pasko Panalo Club provides an online calculator and member tracker to simplify your role. The calculator lets you adjust variables like the number of participants (1-50), weeks (8-24), contribution amounts (starting at 100 PHP), and new fields like inflation adjustment or insurance costs to plan effectively. The tracker records member data, including payments, preferred payout splits, and referral counts, saving you time.
   - As a trustee, you can add your name, contact information, and group location to the system for coordination, making it easier to manage multiple groups.

3. **Flexible and Manageable Role**
   - You can start with a small group and grow up to a maximum group size cap (beyond 50 if needed). The scheme fits around your schedule, requiring only occasional check-ins, and you can set a cycle start date distinct from member signups for better planning.
   - The festive theme, tied to Filipino Christmas traditions, keeps the process enjoyable, with features like progress dashboards and animations to engage your group.

4. **Community Leadership Opportunity**
   - As a trustee, you become a key figure in helping your community save effectively. This role builds trust and respect, and the success of the scheme can strengthen local bonds, especially during the holiday season. Tracking referral counts can also encourage growth through word-of-mouth.

### Why This is Good for New Members

1. **Affordable Way to Save for Christmas**
   - Members contribute a weekly amount (starting at 100 PHP) over a cycle (up to 24 weeks), aiming for a payout of around 8,000 PHP. This helps them avoid expensive loans or credit, with inflation adjustments ensuring the value holds. They can choose their payment method (e.g., cash, mobile payment) for convenience.
   - The flexible contribution lets them select an amount they can afford, and an insurance cost per participant adds a safety net.

2. **Practical Payout Options**
   - Members can set a preferred payout split between cash and a food bundle (e.g., rice, canned goods, holiday treats), tailored to their Noche Buena needs. For instance, a 50/50 split of 8,000 PHP gives 4,000 PHP cash and a 4,000 PHP food bundle, with packaging costs included and a 10% discount off the recommended retail price.
   - The bundle includes items like a 10Kg bag of rice, canned goods, and treats, with costs negotiated down through wholesale discounts.

3. **Clear Progress Tracking**
   - An online dashboard shows members their savings progress, weeks paid, and payout date, adjusted for any emergency withdrawal options. This transparency motivates them to stay on track, with festive animations like parols and stars adding encouragement.
   - They can see estimated savings (e.g., 2,000 PHP) versus alternative costs, reinforced by referral bonuses for bringing in new members.

4. **Community Support and Fairness**
   - The scheme fosters a sense of togetherness, as members save alongside neighbors or friends. A small late fee (set by you) and a reserve fund contribution encourage timely payments, ensuring fairness for all.
   - With your guidance, they benefit from a structured plan that prepares them for Christmas without last-minute pressure, supported by your contact information for support.

### How to Spread the Word

1. **Share the Savings Benefit**
   - Explain to potential members how contributing 500 PHP weekly for 16 weeks results in 8,000 PHP, adjusted for inflation, and how a 10% discount on food bundles (e.g., rice at 900 PHP instead of 1,000 PHP) saves them money. Mention the insurance cost as a safety feature.

2. **Show the Trustee’s Role**
   - Let them know you’ll manage the process with easy tools, recording their preferred payout split and payment method. Mention your commission and administrative fee as fair rewards for your effort, and share your contact information for trust.

3. **Start Small and Grow**
   - Suggest starting with a few trusted people (e.g., 5-10 members) and using the calculator to show how different group sizes, weeks, and wholesale discounts work. Highlight the maximum group size cap as a growth goal.

4. **Highlight Community Value**
   - Emphasize how the scheme brings the community together for a common goal—enjoying a stress-free Christmas. Encourage them to add to the referral count by inviting others.

### Getting Started as a Trustee

- **Set Up Your Group**: Gather a small number of interested people and agree on a weekly contribution, cycle length (e.g., 500 PHP for 16 weeks), and cycle start date. Record your trustee name, contact information, and group location.
- **Use the Tools**: Visit the online calculator (trustee/calculator.html) to plan finances with new fields like canned goods RRP and packaging costs, and the member tracker (trustee/member-data.html) to record details, including payment methods and preferred splits.
- **Guide Members**: Help them sign up with a start date, explain the payout options, and note any emergency withdrawal preferences. The system will handle calculations and tracking.
- **Start Simple**: Begin with one cycle, adjust based on feedback (e.g., inflation adjustment), and grow to the maximum group size cap over time. Consider an insurance cost or reserve fund to enhance stability.
